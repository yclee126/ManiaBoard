ManiaBoard (Osu! Keyboard)
==========================

A multi-functional gaming keyboard.

This has been for over a year before uploaded here(and everywhere else), and still WIP.

..For that reason, the code become really massive and finally filled up 99% of Pro Micro's storage. Ah, great.

Uses Arduino Pro Micro(Arduino Leonardo), WS2812B LED strip, Kalih Sockets.
